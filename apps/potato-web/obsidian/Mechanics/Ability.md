# Ability

An ability can be an [Attack](Mechanics/Attack.md) or a [Spell](Mechanics/Spell.md). 

A unit can have many abilities. All abilities have independent cooldowns.

The cooldown is affected by [Attack Cooldown](Stats/Attack%20Cooldown.md) or [Spell Cooldown](Stats/Spell%20Cooldown.md) depending on its type.

## Weapon Ability

Refers to the ability granted by a weapon, that is, a Weapon Attack or Weapon Spell. 

When using an ability that instructs you to make a Weapon Attack or Weapon Spell, like [Powershot](Abilities/Attacks/Powershot.md), if the character is equipped with two weapons, only the main weapon will be used to trigger the attack. The secondary weapon will not be utilized for this particular ability.
